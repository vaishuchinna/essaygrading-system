In the view of educational institutions, assignments or essays play an important role in assessing the ability of students to understand and recall the topics explained to the students. The manual evaluation of these papers takes a lot of effort and time of the evaluators hence resulting in a time consuming process. The solution to grade a large number of papers effectively within a stipulated time is to let the machine do the grading. The automated grading system will not only reduce the time of evaluation but comparing it with human scores will also make the score more realistic. The project aim is to develop a system which grades an essay or a paper without any manual involvement. When an essay is loaded into the proposed grading system, the system accepts the essay given as the input and grades it using deep learning techniques and its layers such as LSTM and dense layers. This proposed system is useful while grading papers in smart schools and educational institution.
